React Webapp Boilerplate
========================

## Quick start

```bash
$ curl https://codeload.github.com/Blackrush/react-webapp-boilerplate/tar.gz/master | tar xzf -
$ mv react-webapp-boilerplate myapp
$ cd myapp
$ yarn install
$ yarn start
```

## Why ?

It gets pretty boring to bootstrap new projects for the ground up.
So take some vacation and just use this boilerplate :wink:

## What ?

* [Babel](http://babeljs.io/): ES2015 - ES2016 - ES2017 - Stage 0 - async/await - polyfills
* [SCSS](http://sass-lang.com/)
* [Reset CSS](http://meyerweb.com/eric/tools/css/reset/)
* [Webpack](https://webpack.github.io/) + [Webpack-dev-server](https://webpack.github.io/docs/webpack-dev-server.html)
* [Font-Awesome](http://fontawesome.io/icons/)
* [Eslint](http://eslint.org/)
* [Flow](https://flowtype.org/)
* [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/)
* [Redux](https://github.com/reactjs/redux)
